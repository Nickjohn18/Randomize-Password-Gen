# Randomize-Password-Gen

In this project, I used JavaScript to generate secured random passwords for users. It consisted of four different character types that each individual users can specifically pick. The four different types are special characters, upper case letters, lower case letters and numbers. The users can pick in between 8 and 128 characters length, then it will prompt the series of confirm functions for the four different types of characters. The user's password then will be displayed in the box below where you can then copy and save it.
